1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13z0u0k2Lone4Le34FU4NdymBaH

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52J0u0kDoG0lQOmiSzoS2qpEljs
