## ITMD 362, Production Problem 03: Color Palettes

For this production problem, you’re going to create several custom color palettes on the site
Paletton, http://paletton.com.

Choose a palette based on each prompt, and paste the Paletton URL in with your chosen palette
(you’ll see that the uid value in the Paletton URL changes with each adjustment that you make).
Write a few sentences explaining why you chose the colors you did.

1. A monochromatic color palette for a site introducing a new console gaming platform

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=13z0u0k2Lone4Le34FU4NdymBaH

Your Rationale: I wanted to base the colors off the trend with smartphones and "premium" devices and how they describe their products as made with premium materials (like aluminum or some other metal variant) with accent colors (in this case, a nice, dark shade of blue).

2. An adjacent color palette for announcing springtime tours at the Chicago Botanical Gardens

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=52J0u0kDoG0lQOmiSzoS2qpEljs

Your Rationale: I wanted my base color to be a light shade of green to emphasize the idea of spring, a welcome change from the murky weather conditions of the prior season, coupled with bright pastel like shades of yellow (sun) and blue (sky and rain).

3. A triadic color palette for styling the login page for an app for kids to learn the alphabet

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=33s0u0klZtg82EEgovysZtExBpr

Your Rationale: I went with subtle colors that are easy on the eyes instead of very bright or very dark colors that can be a distraction (or deterrent) to basic learning.

4. A custom color palette for advertising a course on cybersecurity

Your Palette URL: http://paletton.com/#uid=b2R1Y3J0kbndscHP8cZrBec4Omp1h

Your Rationale: For some reason, I was originally going to go for something Matrix-esque when I saw "cybersecurity", but rather than just going for black and neon green, I opted for a muted green shade with adjacent blue-indigo and dark golden-beige colors since to me cybersecurity focuses on the small details that are flawed and overlooked rather than the sparkly features that are emphasized in front.
